		"Good rentals disappear fast. By the time they reach listing sites, they're already taken. You refresh, set alerts, and still miss out. It's frustrating, competitive, and exhausting for anyone searching for a new home.",
		"Company was built for renters who are tired of coming in last. We give you access to off-market listings directly from agents, landlords, and property managers. These are listings you won't find on traditional platforms—because they're not public yet. Our growing network and early-access model mean you're first in line before competition even knows the listing exists.",
		"We're on a mission to reshape the $50B rental market—starting with renters who want a smarter way to search. Our goal is to bring 1 million users into a faster, fairer, and more efficient rental experience fueled by exclusive data and network effects. Renting shouldn't feel like a race you're always losing. With Company, you're finally ahead."
